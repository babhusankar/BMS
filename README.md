In the  beginning create a USER INTERFACE is bit easy.
Encapsulates each entity (Case, Management Report, Work Order) with its properties, making it easy to map database records to Java objects.
Ensuring data models accurately represent database tables; if thereâ€™s a mismatch, data retrieval and display issues could arise.
Since the servlet only supports read operations, any complex data processing would require additional logic or further optimization in the servlet.
When handling large amounts of data, passing all data to the servlet and then to the frontend could lead to memory issues.
